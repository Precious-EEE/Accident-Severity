# ðŸš— Accident Severity Prediction Using ML & DL  

## Overview  
This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents using **machine learning and deep learning models**. By analyzing key accident features such as weather conditions, road type, and vehicle involvement, the system provides insights to help reduce accident risks and improve road safety.  

## Features  
âœ… Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection.  
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): correlation analysis and visualization using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**.  
âœ… Model training using **Machine Learning (ML) models**:  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
âœ… Deep Learning (DL) implementation using **Neural Networks** (TensorFlow/Keras).  
âœ… Model evaluation: **Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/accident-severity-prediction.git
cd accident-severity-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of accident records with features such as:  
- **Weather Conditions**  
- **Road Surface Type**  
- **Traffic Volume**  
- **Time of Accident**  
- **Number of Vehicles Involved**  

## Running the Model  
To train and test the accident severity prediction model:  
```sh
python train_model.py
```
